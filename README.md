 100-Day Project :"Donor - Blood donation site"
 
      Donating blood is important in day to-day life so that we can save many lives.
      Keep that as an inspiriration, I had created an website that solves the blood demand issues.
      "Yours donation is other person's life, Its not only considered as a donation, Its giving life"
