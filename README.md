100-Day Project :"Donor - Blood donation site" Donating blood is important in
day to-day life so that we can save many lives. Keep that as an inspiriration, I
had created an website that solves the blood demand issues. "Yours donation is
other person's life, Its not only considered as a donation, Its giving life"
What does DONOR does? 1. Blood availabilty in differnet regions can be viewed.
2. Blood donors are found and contacted easily. 3. Locations of Bloodcamps are
updated, so that voluntering people can donate. Problem statement -
